"# Thesis" 

I consider myself a strong back end dev, so my main focus was to get teh api and database set up and working.

I enjoy working in Domain driven development and Clean architecture, although there is some elements of vertical slice as i think mixing the 2 works quite well.

I use entity framework to access the database and fluent results as the return of the endpoints.

I opted for sql server simply because i already had one set up in my own docker container
